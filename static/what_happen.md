### Doing it

Make markdown page - MARIANNE
  * add basic password
  * add text diff check before sending (_right now sends every 15 seconds_)
  * add notification for 2 users being connected at once
  * add regular view and 'edit view'
  * make sure that markdown spacing is not weird

### Thinking about it

Dynamic placement / scrolling of boxes so if the screen is small the contact info/committees/social media info doesn’t dwarf the picture and make the tile huge

Possibly also get social media things for state reps? 

Make all boxes fixed height

Add something that checks for invalid social media link before displaying - MARIANNE

Separate bills into larger categories and display that instead
(add to state level) bill breakdown

how to differentiate between state vs. country level

how to display title (State House/Senate/House of Representatives)

Add actionables for contact information

Display some sort of small game when pulling for data for the first time

Make it so that candidates committees are in tab for ‘current term’

Make it so that candidate committees are clickable

Too long of text, limit text by box 

Fix financial data bug (look at what happens for Arizona senator)

Display total money raised somewhere on rep tile

How to make website faster
Have requests cache, but need metrics

HTML5 ASTEROIDS while you wait (Jessi talk to Mikey) 

We need a page to list our sources

possibly make historical searches more accessible?
